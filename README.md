# Bootstrap Bio - Take Home Analysis

Key Question: If we knew the results of some percentage of clinical trials, what sort of ROI should we expect? How much does each stock move for each announcement?

# QUICKSTART (CLI)
With [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
installed, run this commands to get up and running in ~10min 
as you'll download the entire clinicaltrials.gov database and FDA approval file.

_Note, I have a Macbook with the M2 chip so your environment might not translate._
_The better path would be to have this spun up in a server but that's a later problem_ ðŸ˜‰

```
chmod +x setup_structure.sh
./setup_structure.sh

# Notes to future self
- FDA data only shows True Positives (ie it does _not_ return drugs failing approval eg Simufilam by NASDAQ:SAVA)
   - Relatedly, there might be issues on comparing 
- Using [the ClinicalTrail.gov API](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/about-api) and not their [search feature](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?resFirstPost=2014-11-21_2024-11-21&aggFilters=results:with)
- Once I had all the Lead Sponsors from Clinical Trials, I manually downloaded and joined NYSE and NASDAQ data to get ~300 companies of the 7k.
- [Study showing this works](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9439234/) that used a data service that's prohibitively expensive; [another paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-39301-4) that used [BioPharmaAnalyst data](https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/sign-up)
- Make modular updates to MongoDB vs slash & burn
- Use OpenFDA API instead of the [manual download](https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/drugsfda/download/) that was uploaded & updated on Dec 12, 2024
- There are often multiple names associated with a drug across data sources 
   - eg In the FDA, BIZENGRI is the brand name for the active ingredient "ZENOCUTUZUMAB-ZBCO" but Clinical Trials has "Zenocutuzumab" and "MCLA-128"
   - The sponsor matches (FDA `MERUS N.V.`; CT `Merus N.V.`)
- Maybe use [Regulations.gov API](https://open.gsa.gov/api/regulationsgov/) to pull data on comments made about companies?

# Data Dictionary

## Clinical Trials
```
protocolSection.identificationModule.nctId (always one value)
protocolSection.sponsorCollaboratorsModule.leadSponsor.name (always one value)
protocolSection.statusModule.lastUpdatePostDateStruct.date (always one value)
protocolSection.interventions.name (but not `name: 'Placebo'`; this can still return multiple values)
protocolSection.interventions.otherNames (list)
protocolSection.statusModule.overallStatus (directional but not definitive)
protocolSection.oversightModule.isFdaRegulatedDrug
protocolSection.designModule.phases ('PHASE3')
protocolSection.statusModule.lastUpdateSubmitDate
```

## FDA
```
results.application_number (unique ID)
results.sponsor_name (might match `company_ct`)
products.brand_name
products.active_ingredients
openfda.substance_name
openfda.generic_name
results.submissions.submission_status_date (when submission_type = "ORIG" and submission_code = "AP")
results.submissions.submission_status, 
results.submissions.submission_class_code
